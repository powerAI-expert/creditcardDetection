# Credit Card Fraud Detection Project: Detecting fraudulent transactions

The project focuses on detecting fraud in credit card transactions using techniques such as data processing, logistic regression, random forest, SMOTE, and Flask for building a web application.
Key aspects:
1.	Data Processing: Preprocessing and cleaning credit card data to ensure accuracy and reliability.
2.	Logistic Regression: Building a predictive model using logistic regression to identify fraudulent transactions based on relevant features.
3.	Random Forest: Utilizing the random forest algorithm to improve the accuracy and robustness of the fraud detection model.
4.	SMOTE: Employing the SMOTE technique to address class imbalance in the dataset, enhancing the modelâ€™s ability to detect fraudulent transactions.
The ultimate goal of the project is to develop a reliable and efficient system that can identify fraudulent credit card transactions, helping to protect individuals and businesses from financial losses.
